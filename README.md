# Simple PPM Image Viewer
I made this in C++ because I was bored. Inspired by [Daniel Hirsch's video](https://youtu.be/sItRLFjbqvo).

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2026
- [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/)
  - You need to include the SDL3.h and SDL3.lib in your project
  - SDL3.dll needs to be included in the build folder
## Using the program
Place P6 type .ppm (it should not have comments in it!) file in the same folder as your compiled program or in the project folder where .slnx file is located (Visual Studio Default).
